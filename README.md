# Inner Product Arguments Library for Curves on Bandersnatch, built on top of Constantine.

This is a mild attempt to building a generic Math library for `Inner Product Arguments` for `Multiproofs`, and other cryptographic implementations like `zkSNARKs` in the [Nim Programming Language](https://nim-lang.org/documentation.html), intended to be build keeping in mind the [Verkle Trie](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/verkle-trees/) migration of the [Nimbus Execution Client of Ethereum](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth1), by [Status](https://status.im/). To learn more about the *Nim Porgramming Language*, you may visit [Nim By Example](https://nim-by-example.github.io/) or [Nim Days](https://github.com/xmonader/nimdays).

### Setting up the repo
This is an experimental project, if goes well, will be integrated to Ethereum Verkle Tries. The existing crypto primitives used in this project has been taken from [Constantine](https://github.com/mratsim/constantine) by [mratism](https://github.com/mratsim/)

Head onto the terminal at root dir of the project and type:

```
$ cd src
$ git submodule add https://github.com/mratsim/constantine constantine
```
### Notice :)

Currently development is in Progress üë∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I will try to add more dirs for `Research` on `Inner Product Arguments`, `Elliptic Curve Crypto`, `Extension Fields` and much more.
